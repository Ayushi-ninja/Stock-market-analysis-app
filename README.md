📈 Stock Market Analysis App

A project developed as part of my 10-day Add-on Course on Microsoft Azure AI-102

This project is a Python-based Stock Market Analysis Application that fetches stock data, processes it, and provides meaningful insights. It demonstrates core skills like data handling, visualization, API usage, and analytical computation — all useful foundations for AI/ML and Azure AI-102 learning paths.

🚀 Features

📊 Fetches and analyzes stock market data

🔍 Shows trends, highs/lows, and historical insights

🧮 Uses Python for calculations and data processing

📈 Can be expanded to include predictions

🐍 Fully implemented in Python

🎯 Great practice for cloud and AI workflows (Azure AI-102)
